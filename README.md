This is a sample for C++ interface for MobileNet-SSD,
modified from ssd_detect.cpp in SSD(https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/blob/ssd/examples/ssd/ssd_detect.cpp).

The code is self-explained.
The key is the preprocessing of the input image.

Also it may help the beginners to build a project using cmake.
You don't need to build this within the caffe root.
But remember you should compile caffe first.
